# KRIBHCO-Fertilisers-Ltd.-Urea-Plant-Report

Project Title: KFL Urea Manufacturing Process and Plant Analysis

Challenge: The objective was to provide a detailed report on the urea manufacturing process at KRIBHCO Fertilizers Limited (KFL), a major Indian fertilizer producer. The project required a deep dive into the plant's operational data, key equipment specifications, and the chemical engineering principles that govern urea production from raw materials.

Methodology:

Plant Capacity and Performance Analysis: The analysis began by detailing the plant's production capabilities. The report noted a total urea production capacity of 2620 Metric Tons Per Day (MTPD), split across two identical streams, each with a capacity of 1310 MTPD. The plant's operational excellence was highlighted by its consistent capacity utilization of over 100%, with a peak recorded production of 3280 MTPD.

Raw Materials and Product: The core of the process was identified as the synthesis of urea from ammonia (NH 
3
​
 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 
2
​
 ). The report specified the final product, Neem Coated Urea, as an enhanced fertilizer with a high nitrogen content of 46%.

Process Technology and Equipment: The report documented the use of specific technologies:

Ammonia Plant: A single-stream facility with a 1520 MTPD capacity utilizing Haldor Topsoe Technology.

Urea Plant: Utilized Saipem Technology, known for its efficiency and yield maximization.

Equipment: The report described various critical equipment, including Globe valves for flow throttling, Gate valves for high-pressure isolation in the synthesis loop, and Shell and Tube heat exchangers capable of handling high-pressure and high-temperature fluids.

Certifications and Operational Milestones: The report included key business and operational metrics, such as the plant's commissioning date (25th November 1995) and its compliance with international standards like ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018.

Results and Impact:

Quantitative Documentation: The project provides a highly quantified overview of a major industrial process, using precise figures for production capacities, nitrogen content, and operational performance.

Technical Proficiency: The report demonstrates a solid understanding of chemical engineering principles and the practical application of process equipment, as evidenced by the detailed descriptions of valves and heat exchangers.

Comprehensive Analysis: By combining operational data with technology and safety standards, the report presents a holistic view of the plant's functions, showcasing the ability to analyze a complex industrial system from multiple perspectives.

Professional Reporting Skills: The project is structured as a formal report, demonstrating the ability to compile, organize, and present technical information clearly and concisely, which is a vital skill in a professional engineering environment.
